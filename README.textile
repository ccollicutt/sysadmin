h1. centos.sh

This script will, assuming a whole bunch of things are setup as it expects, be able to create a CentOS virtual machine on both Ubuntu 10.04 + kvm and Centos 5.6 + xen dom0s using a combination of mrepo, kickstarts, virt-install, and lvm.

Why? Well, because that's what I have--a Lucid workstation and a CentOS 5 test server. I want to be able to easily create CentOS 5 servers on both of these systems in order to build a test, or perhaps better termed learning, network .

h1. dejabootstrap.sh

This script will create as many vms as you want, half going to a kvm dom0 and half going to a xen dom0 server.

It requires a lot of "stuff" to be setup "properly", but it should be fairly obvious where to put what. I'm sorry it's messy.  The big things are:

# "kicker":https://github.com/curtisgithub/kicker
## Which requires a http available place to put kickstarts
# "centos.sh":https://github.com/curtisgithub/sysadmin/blob/master/centos.sh and it's configuration file
# A kvm dom0 and a xen dom0 setup with ssh access from where the script is run from.
## Each having a volume group with the same name, eg. "/dev/vm"
# DNS entries for each $HOSTPREFIX$s.$DOMAIN that is being created
